# -Analyzing-Customer-Behavior-and-Building-a-Booking-Prediction-Model-for-British-Airways

This project focuses on analyzing customer booking data from British Airways to gain insights and predict customer behavior. 
The dataset includes various features such as purchase_lead time, length_of_stay, sales_channel, and more. 
The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between variables, identify outliers, and visualize patterns.
Attached in this repository are the analysis powerpoint slides.

Following the EDA, a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, is trained to predict customer bookings. 
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. 
The findings highlight a negative correlation between purchase_lead time and length_of_stay, indicating that customers who book earlier tend to have longer stays. 
Outliers in purchase_lead time and length_of_stay are also identified.
